                        <h2>Hello (again), World - July 7th 2025</h2>
                        <p>Hi, once again i'm back here. Maybe there is a little chance that i didn't post here for a little time (6 months) but thats aside hello again everybody. Today i just wanted to write what i was doing and what i want to do from now on.</p>
                        <p>Ok so first of all i started making a new game. I'm trying to make it as good as i can but i do think i'll restart because of the un-expendable nature of it. But i might post some photos of it one of the reasons being its the best dungeon generation i've made and i'm really proud of it. It's like a mix of a cutesy game with fantasy rpg dungeon crawler things in it. Anyways since i'll be starting highschool this year i'm really exited and i will be for real now i dont know what more to write. OH.. I'll be joining to the Brackey's game jam this year. Hopefully i could make something.</p>
                        <p>Another thing i wanna complete is the esp-32 mp3 player thing witht the Walkman TPS-L2 shell, i have the components but i just can't get a audio output from it so if anybody is willing to help i'll really appreciate it. </p>
                        <p>And i really wanna start the youtube thing but i'm not sure, mostly because my really underpowered computer, but i hope it'll change. And i think for last i really want to be able to make this blog thing easier. I've been thinking of making a private thing and writing these on that private site than pushing the file to the github repo with a button. It might be hard but i think i'd figure it out.</p>
                        <p>Anyways once again thank for reading, and goodbye.</p>
