                        <h2>Hello everyone, once again... </h2>
                        <p>Sooo... yeah her and i has broke up since the last blog post, but anyways i shouldn't care anyways. So what's todays blog is about, it's that i wanna make a game again but like i cant find a proper idea.</p>
                        <p>So i can't find any ideas, i've tried to make a isaac like game and actually got the dungeon generation up and running and i'll be posting the code here but i've since given up on that. I think i wanna make a fps like Doom but i don't really wanna learn c++, i can make really simple games/game but i don't think it will be suitable for 3d development (i know that doom is a 2d game in its code but it's presented as a 3d game).</p>
                        <p>Then another idea of mine was to make a rpg with raylib and c++ like a video i saw the other day from Goodgis, but i don't really like the rpg's i make and i couldn't figure out how could i make tileset collisions, but i figure that out i probably could make and and maybe even a little rogue like game. But yeah as you all probably know, i'm a 8th grader in Turkiye and it's really hard to do your hobies because of LGS.</p>
                        <p>But there are some little demos that i've made in this time span like a little ball collecting game in c++ and raylib, the isaac like dungeon generator i've mentioned, and it's actually really easy to implament in your own game because the generator is just 1 file, and some little isometric demos and stuff. Not something worth mentioning.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>By the way here is the dungeon generator script, you can modify the configuration of the max rooms, room size, min rooms and grid size : </p>
