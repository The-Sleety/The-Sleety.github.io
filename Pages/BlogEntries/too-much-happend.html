                        <h2>Hello chat it's me again...</h2>
                        <p>So sup guys, i just wanted to write a  blog because it has been on my mind for some time now. Ok so lemme start with the website updates.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Nothing much has happened with the website but i've added the playlist to the <a href="/Pages/AboutMe.html">about me page</a> finally, and that's actually it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Now with the life updates that probably no one cares (Guys i swear i will make usefull blogs in the future). Soooo... Some thing big, really really big has happend to me. I GOT A GIRLFRIEND. Yeahhhhh. Anyway, she is super awsome and i love her too much, she is a 11/10, the is the coolest, and the most beatiful girl i've seen (aside from my mom, sister, grandma and my aunt ofc). We've had a date today and it was awsome. I even had my first kiss (Tho it's embrrassing to say that i got my first kiss in the age of 14), but i'd like to be with her for a long-ass time. Because again, she is super awsome and cute and pretty and cool and everything. I'm not gonna put her picture here for privaciy reasons. But i like her very much and she likes me very much. I don't even know know how i pulled her to be honest. But i'm glad i did because we are really happy together.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>That's it for today guys, i got a bit personal today but i think next one's gonna be more on the technical and electronical side, anyways see y'all in the next one...</p>
